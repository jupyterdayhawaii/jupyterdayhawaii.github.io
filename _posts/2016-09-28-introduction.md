**JupyterDay Hawaii**

**Manoa Innovation Center**

**1:30pm - 4:00pm**

Aloha! Project Jupyter and PyHawaii are pleased to announce the first JupyterDay in Hawaii  on ***Saturday, October 29, 2016*** from ***12:00pm-4pm*** at the ***Manoa Innovation Center***. 

JupyterDay Hawaii is an afternoon workshop dedicated to the free and open-source Jupyter Notebook and its underlying architecture. The objective of this afternoon workshop is to showcase Jupyter’s capabilities and to foster creative and productive dialogues on how various Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) fields can leverage the Jupyter notebook in their workflow. 

JupyterDay Hawaii is free and open to the public, especially members of the programming community, practitioners, students, academia, and researchers. We require registration to ensure we have enough food and seating. Complimentary refreshments and pupus will be provided. Registration is open now and will only take a minute, [register here](https://jupyterdayhawaii.eventbrite.com).

######What is Jupyter? 
The Jupyter Notebook, formerly known as IPython, "is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more." 
Source: https://jupyter.org

Users can create “notebooks” with readable inputs such as code and text elements in order to conduct data analysis work for science, math, data science, and other analytical purposes. The notebooks are “both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.”

######So what will we be doing?
That's an excellent question! We will have three simultaneous tracks covering a diverse set of topics, including:

* How to get started with Jupyter and other introductory topics

* Using Jupyter in the hard and soft sciences

* Using Jupyter to teach

You are invited to [submit a presentaton proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwDb1lxMSIK2SqB8WRVZAS4j6OOn1w3ZjZnJj0uAkAxBKr6w/viewform?c=0&w=1) to present at JupyterDay Hawaii. This is a great opportunity for students, local practitioners, programmers, and researchers to meet other like-minded folks who want to leverage and expand their use of Jupyter.  

Our keynote presenters will cover:

* Getting started with Jupyter and GitHub

* Creating a presentation using Jupyter’s slideshow feature

* Jupyter Basics 101 tutorials

Our tentative schedule is as follows:


12:00PM-1:25PM: Opening Remarks & Getting Started with Jupyter + Refreshments, heavy pupus will be provided
1:30PM-1:55PM: First Session
2:00PM-2:25PM: Second Session
2:30PM-2:55PM: Third Session
