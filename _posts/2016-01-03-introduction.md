JupyterDay Hawaii is an afternoon workshop on the open-source Jupyter/IPython Notebook and its underlying architecture. The objective of this afternoon workshop is to introduce Jupyterâ€™s capabilities and functionalities to the local computing community and to foster creative and productive dialogues on how various STEM fields can leverage Jupyter notebook(s) in their workflow. JupyterDay Hawaii is open to members of the programming community, practicioners, students, academia, and researchers. 

Would you like to participate as a presenter? We are currently accepting proposals for tech talks. 
You have the opportunity to present a 20 minute "how to" or tech talk that will either introduce
the Jupyter architecture to new users or present past projects you have worked on with
Jupyter notebook. We are accepting submissions until Saturday, October 8, 11:59pm. Submit an application today!
